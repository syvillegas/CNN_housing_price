# CNN_housing_price
In this project, we extract visual features from house photographs, by means of a Convolutional Neural network architecture (CNN), and combine it with the housesâ€™ textual information, so that we end up with an enhanced prediction about the fair price of the property in comparison to one given by a baseline linear model.
